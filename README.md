## 📖 About

This project is a markdown template generator app. I developed this tool because it is difficult to constantly create new markdown templates.

### 💡Idea
What if there was an implementation in Markdown that allows defining variables and each loops using template engine constructs like [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)?

### 📚Tech Stack

<table>
<tr>
  <td> <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars Template Engine</a></td>
  <td>It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions.</td>

  <td>Helps maintain consistent coding styles for my working on the same project across various editors and IDEs</td>

## 🧐 What's inside?

There is a sample file in the **templates** directory. You can create your own markdown template by changing this file. The `each` and **variable definition** features in the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) structure are available

## Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Node (v12.0.0+)

- Npm (v6.00+)

### ⚙️ How To Use

You can create your own markdown template by modifying the example file in the **templates** folder. Afterwards, it is enough to paste the template pattern into the `textarea` area and follow the steps.
